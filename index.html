           <h2>Version control with Git and Github.</h2>
           <h3>Hypertext Markup Language(HTML).</h3>
           <p>It started with version control using Git and Github, then moved
           to UI/UX design using Figma, then HTML which stands Hypertext Markup
           Language. 
           </p>
           <p>Version Control with Git and Github is very important as it 
           facilitates collaboration among the Project Team Member which
           is very important as no man is an island in technology.
           </p>
           <p>UI/UX Design with tools like Figma and Canva is also very 
           important as designing the wireframe and prototype of a 
           Product is very important as it enables ease in the Product
           Building process. It also aids the Agile Development 
           Methodology which deals with continuous iteration of a Product.
           </p>
           <p>HTML is very important and is usually used by Frontend Web 
           Developers to develop the structure of the Webpage. It goes hand in hand 
           with CSS and Javascript. Advanced developers use frameworks and Libraries
           like Tailwand CSS, Bootstrap, React JS and Vue JS.
           </p>
           <p>CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheet and it is used to beautify a 
           Webpage. It can get complex really fast therefore Tailwand CSS 
           is very important to aid ease of use
